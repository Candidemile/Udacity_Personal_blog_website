                <h3 class="dark">Cardigan Welsh Corgi</h3>
                <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn-origin-etr.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/12234955/Cardigan-Welsh-Corgi-On-White-03.jpg" alt="image">
                <p class="dark bold">The <span class="bold">Cardigan Welsh Corgi</span> is the older of the two Corgi dog breeds, with dogs of this type believed to have existed in Wales for more than 3,000 years.<br> The Cardigan is distinguished by their long tail—like the sleeves of a cardigan sweater—and was used to drive cattle to market. Known as the yard-long dog, the Cardigan is sensible and affectionate. They love to spend time with their family and are an active, fun-loving playmate for school-age children.</p>
                <p class="dark italic">The Cardigan’s medium-length coat comes in many colors and patterns, including red, brindle, blue merle and black, usually with white markings.</p>
                <q class="dark">The <span class="bold">Cardigan Welsh Corgi</span> is a masterpiece of the breeder’s art: Every aspect of its makeup is perfectly suited to moving cattle, and yet it is so congenial and sweet-faced that it would be a cherished companion even if it never did a day’s work.</q>
